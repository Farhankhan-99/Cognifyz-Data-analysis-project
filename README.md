# 🎯 Aim

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset and uncover meaningful business insights. This analysis was part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies and covered multiple levels of analysis, including:

## Task - 1 :
- 📌 Identifying the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and analyzing their distribution across restaurants.  
- 📌 Examining restaurant distribution and average ratings across different cities to detect regional patterns.  
- 📌 Visualizing how restaurants are spread across various price ranges to understand affordability trends.  
- 📌 Comparing average ratings of restaurants that offer online delivery versus those that do not.

  ## Task - 2 :
- 📌 Determining the most frequent rating intervals and calculating the average number of votes per rating range.  
- 📌 Analyzing commonly occurring cuisine combinations and how they influence customer ratings.  
- 📌 Mapping restaurant coordinates to visualize geographic clusters and city-specific concentrations.  
- 📌 Evaluating restaurant chains with multiple outlets and identifying the top performers based on outlet count and ratings.
